			<p class="about-intro">Hi there, I'm Brittany.</p>

			<p>
				I'm currently an <strong>Opportunity Year fellow</strong> at the{" "}
				<strong>Washington Post</strong>, but normally I'm a graphics
				reporter who focuses on full-stack development. I am also an
				adjunct professor at{" "}
				<strong>The University of Maryland, College Park</strong>. I was
				raised by NPR Visuals, and I'm an alumna of the beautiful
				University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
			</p>

			<p>
				During my fellowship, I'm embedded on the Social Issues team
				under the Post's Local desk. I'm focusing on sharpening my
				writing and reporting skills with the goal of more deeply
				integrating human-centered storytelling into graphics and data
				reporting.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm always thinking about: Processes, aspirational skills,
				hiring and organizational hierarchy + fostering collaboration.
				Talk to me about any of these!
