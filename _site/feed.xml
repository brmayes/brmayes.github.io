        <title>Semi Automatic Weapons Without A Background Check Can Be Just A Click Away</title>
        <description>[{&quot;para&quot;=&gt;&quot;In reaction to the Orlando shooting on June 12, 2016, NPR produced exclusive online content about the availability of guns through third-party sites like &lt;a href=\&quot;armslist.com\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Armslist.com&lt;/a&gt;. For this piece, I co-wrote a python script to scrape the listings of the site back 90 days. We collected various information including location, price, and gun type. We then used it to make a data-driven piece and to create several data visualizations showing the hotspots in gun sales on the site and the number of guns sold per state.&quot;}]</description>
