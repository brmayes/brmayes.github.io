                Hello there! I'm Brittany.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nice to meet you. Iâ€™m an alumna of the beautiful University of
                North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I was a student in the School of Media and Journalism,
                and now I'm on to my next big step living full-time in the greater D.C. area.
              </p>
              <p>
                Code is something I love, and I'm lucky that I get to do it everyday. I'm pursuing a
                full-time job in news as an news apps designer/developer. Until then,
                I've been doing some contract and temp work for NPR (and others).
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm passionate, inquisitive and enthusiastic. I never want to stop learning.
                So that was a little about me. I'd love to hear from you.
