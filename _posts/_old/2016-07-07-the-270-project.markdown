  - para: For in depth coverage and analysis of the U.S. election, we decided to make an interactive slider for a basis to show how the numbers of the election can be manipulated to favor one of the two major parties.
  - para: The reporter, NPRâ€™s Asma Khalid, used the interactive to perform some crazy number-crunching and produced an in-depth analysis of what it would take to get Trump to the White House.
