tldr: In reaction to the Orlando shooting on June 12, 2016, NPR produced exclusive online content about the availability of guns through third-party sites like Armslist.com. I wrote a scraper and analyzed the data for visualization.

  - para: In reaction to the Orlando shooting on June 12, 2016, NPR produced exclusive online content about the availability of guns through third-party sites like Armslist.com. For this piece, I co-wrote a python script to scrape the listings of the site back 90 days. We collected various information including location, price, and gun type. We then used it to make a data-driven piece and to create several data visualizations showing the hotspots in gun sales on the site and the number of guns sold per state.
