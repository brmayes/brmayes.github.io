tldr: Four or more people have been killed in a mass shooting every 47 days, on average, since June 17, 2015 when a young white supremacist killed nine people at a historic African American church in Charleston, S.C. This weekend, the 30th and 31st such shootings since then took place just 13 hours apart.
