project-title: Russia Context Cards (Cardbuilder)
project-url: https://www.npr.org/2017/06/02/526417478/the-trump-russia-comey-imbroglio-it-s-complicated
role: Designer
code: https://github.com/nprapps/cardbuilder
tldr: The idea of the NPR Context Cards came about by a short meeting with a general reporter who wanted to help "catch readers up" on the Russia Investigation. Two other members of the Visuals team and I collaborated to bring the cards to life from an assumptions meeting to launch.
